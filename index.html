                <img src="assets/images/portfolio.jpg" style="width: 200px; height: 225px;" class="auth-image" alt="Justin">
                <p>I am a long time computer enthusiast who has worked over the last three years to expand my knowledge in web development and coding. Years after completing high school and exploring other jobs, my interest in computer science has never left but only increased. I decided to finally act on this passion and begin my career in web development. </p>
                <p>I completed a web development program in 2018 and am a certificated Full Stack Developer. While this is a new career for me, my past experiences have all taught me valuable lessons that can be applied to any opportunity. The greatest lesson I learned through my various jobs of installing networks, sub contracting construction sites, and managing customer requests through various roles, was about myself and how problem solving is my greatest quality. I am looking forward to collaborating with a future team on web projects, where I can not only help build websites but problem solve with others on how to make specific projects better.  </p>
                <p>My specialties include a multitude of approaches and platforms to solve programming tasks. My skill set ranges from JavaScript, HTML, CSS, React, Node, mySQL and more. I bring a unique and innovated style when developing existing projects. Thriving in a fast-paced environment where there are frequent challenges is what motivates me as a developer. I am also eager to seize new opportunities and responsibilities. I work well independently and in collaboration with others.
